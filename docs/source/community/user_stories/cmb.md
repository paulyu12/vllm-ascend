# China Merchants Bank

**About / Introduction**

[China Merchants Bank (CMB) ](https://www.cmbchina.com) is the first joint-stock commercial bank wholly owned by corporate legal entities in Chinese mainland. It prioritised technological advancement. With “AI + Finance” as the key focus, CMB promoted innovation in products, services, businesses, models, and management by technological innovation, accelerating the transition from an “Online CMB” to a “Digital & Intelligent CMB”.
